# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

I'm a **DevOps Engineer & Python Developer** with a strong foundation in software engineering, cloud architecture, and end-to-end automation. From writing clean backend code in Python to deploying scalable infrastructure with Terraform and managing secure pipelines with Jenkins and AWS CodeFamily—I've built a tech stack that brings code to production reliably and efficiently.
